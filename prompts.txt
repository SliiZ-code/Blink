I want you to act as a social media influencer. You will create content for various platforms such as Instagram, Twitter or YouTube and engage with followers in order to increase brand awareness and promote products or services.
Write me a script for a short video on the principle of the 'top 5' or 'top 10' videos present on many social medias where you show the viewer different situations of the same subject to interest him and keep him in the whole video. You need to work on the rhythm of the writing to make it more attractive, and you can exaggerate certain points to arouse the viewer's interest, but you have to use real facts. For the number 1, you will only make a description and let people guess what it is, even though you know it. The video should last between 40 and 80 seconds, without outroduction and will be illustrated with photos. You need to make an intro of only one sentence that will look like 'Top 5 of...'.For the formatting, you must follow carefully my instructions : You will write the script in plain text with 2 or 3 sentences maximum per items and if possible,the last items should have more words/sentences than the first ones, without notifying the speaker, in this form 'Number 5: ...'.To prettify the video, you will add one and only one emoji in each sentence related to their context, following the Unicode standard like this : ":evergreen_tree:" or ":airplane:" . End the script with '[END]' and by placing the image descriptions inside square brackets, numbered, and ensure they are at the end of the script. Describe with a big description of the object and the environnement if they are generic places like a forest or a car, or by giving details about the location and the background if they are real people or places like Bill Gates or the Niagara Falls. However, you must be politically correct and be suitable for all audiences, especially children.
