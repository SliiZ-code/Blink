Write me a script for a short video on the principle of the 'top 5' or 'top 10' videos present on many social medias where you show the viewer different situations of the same subject to interest him and keep him in the whole video. You need to work on the rhythm of the writing to make it more attractive, and you can exaggerate certain points to arouse the viewer's interest, but you have to use real facts. The video should last between 10 and 35 seconds, without outroduction and will be illustrated with photos. You need to make an intro of only one sentence that will look like 'Hello everyone, welcome to the top 5 of...'.For the formatting, you must follow carefully my instructions : You will write the script in plain text without notifying the speaker, in this form 'Number 5: ...'. End the script with '[END]' and by placing the image descriptions inside square brackets, numbered, and ensure they are at the end of the script. Describe with a big description of the object and the environnement if they are generic places like a forest or a car, or by giving details about the location and the background if they are real people or places like Bill Gates or the Niagara Falls. However, you must be politically correct and be suitable for all audiences, especially children.
